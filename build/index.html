          Korean natural language library with a new unit of processing

        <div class="content">
          <p>
            Hangul looks like, in a perspective, rather an intricate system especially when you want the machine to understand it. The history of researching on how to process Hangul is not mature enough, which also does not help to deal with the text data of Korean writing system. Nonetheless, it is a systematically built alphabet and tons of clues are to be discovered in order for us to deal with it easier than now.
          </p>
          <p>
            Gimci is designed to tackle the issues lingering over the handling of Hangul and boost the overall performance. It is also expected that people will benefit not only in a technological part, but also in understanding the general linguistic aspect of the writing system.

          <p>
            Hangul characters are each composed of two to three letters (constructing block, 낱자): Initial (초성), Medial (중성), Final (종성). Traditional langauge processing models of Hangul handled the text with the unit of character meaning it considered the total possibilities of11172. (Initial 19 * Medial 21 * Final 28) when dealing with the next character to come. This is a tremendous amount if you scale up the volume to be processed.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now if we can, at all, treat it by the unit of 'letter', the problem may shrink excessively. (Rough calculation dictates that we have40 (Standard 24 + Combined 16) possibilities to lookahead)
          </p>
          <p>
            Quite a jump in the overall performance! But how could we possibly achieve this? An idea of constructing a wholly new set of Romanization began here. it later turned out that the new rule also shed a light to a relationship between each letter of Hangul.

          <p>
            A new set of rule was essential in changing the way Hangul is treated.Bagsynghien Rule (박승현 전사법), largely influenced by a prior work of Fukui Rei was devised.
          </p>
          <p>
            The new rule converts each of Hangul letter into Roman alphabet without so much of exceptions. It also has several characteristics, such that according to the rul,e diphthongs are all modularized into a single vowel.
