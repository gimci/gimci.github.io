          Hangul looks like, in a perspective, rather an intricate system especially when you want the machine to understand it. The history of researching on how to process Hangul is not mature enough, which also does not help to deal with the text data of Korean writing system. Nonetheless, it is a systematically built alphabet and tons of clues are to be discovered in order for us to deal with it easier than now.
        </p>
        <p>
          Gimci is designed to tackle the issues lingering over the handling of Hangul and boost the overall performance. It is also expected that people will benefit not only in a technological part, but also in understanding the general linguistic aspect of the writing system.
